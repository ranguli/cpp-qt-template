# cpp-qt-template

Modern project C++20 project template that uses CMake, Qt 6, QML, and vcpkg.

## About

### Why use this?

There are much more thorough and more popular project templates out there. There's actually very little reason for _you_ to use this, unless your needs are similar to mine. This template doesn't really try to be everything to everyone, it fits my use case, and doesn't contain a lot of stuff I don't need.

### Why use vcpkg?

There are a number of pros to vcpkg:
- We get an actual package manager
    - We don't need to use git submodules, CMake FetchContent, copy code into our repo, use a system package manager (usually), etc.

This gives us slightly more reproducible builds, which is great.

It isn't without downsides:
- I genuinely can't get Qt to work via `vcpkg` yet (at least on Linux) - even via a dependency manager building something like Qt from source is _not_ for the faint of heart apparently.
- **So vcpkg is really here for any non-Qt dependencies**

## Requirements

- CMake â‰¥ 3.21
- Ninja (at least by default, other build presets can be configured)
- C++20
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
- Qt (sourced by you, through your OS package manager or some other means)

## Usage

We're making the assumption you have already installed [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) by cloning it somewhere, running the bootstrap script, and set the `VCPKG_ROOT` envrionment variable.

### Building

The default build is a release build using Ninja:

```bash
cmake --preset=default
cmake --build build
```

Debug builds can made with:

```bash
cmake --preset=default
cmake --build build
```

To do a fresh configure:

```bash
cmake --preset=release --fresh
```

Or powerwash a build:

```bash
cmake --build --preset=release --target clean
```
